Simple AR tilt-controlled racing game prototype

You'll need a device with a gyro to use this app.  A racing circuit is laid out around the player,
which can be viewed by using your device like a camera.

Once you look directly at your car, the game starts and you control your vehicle by tilting the device
left and right to steer.

A lap timer starts when you cross the start/finish line.  If you run off the road then the car will stop
and you will need to drive off in the other direction.

The best lap time for the session is preserved until you leave the game.
